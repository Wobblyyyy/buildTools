# buildTools
Build tools for score.js.
## Building
Compile this as you would any other Java artifact.
## Running
Run the build tools in the same directory as the rest of the score.js files / folders with java -jar <name>
### Options
There are a couple available flags, including...
- `-current` : update a file named score.js instead of creating a new one
- `-qb` or `-nomin` : forgo the online minification process
